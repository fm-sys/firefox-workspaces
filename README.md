# Workspaces - _a beautiful workspace manager for Firefox_

Let's group your tabs into workspaces to navigate through tabs more efficiently.

This extension utilizes tab show and hide APIs so giving it a permission to keep tabs hidden is required.

## Screenshots

[coming shortly]

## Improvements

[x] Send a tab to another workspace by right clicking the tab and choosing which workspace to send it to.

[ ] Save and load workspaces.

[ ] Smoothness in hiding and show tabs between workspace switches.

[ ] Support for commands/shortcuts to open and navigate through the list of workspaces.

## Acknowledgements

This extension was based on [workspace-manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/workspace-manager/) with major adoptions to support tab groups and feature a native look and feel.
